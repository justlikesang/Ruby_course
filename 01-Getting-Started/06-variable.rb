# -A variable is a reference to an obj. That obj is subject to change
# -Variables are sometimes called pointers or identifiers
# -The variable itself is not an object. It is a placeholder for an obj
# -Ruby is dynamically typed. Variables types do not have to be declared.
# The same variable can be reassigned to an object of another data type




# Ruby uses snake case

# The right side of the equal sign is always evaluated first
